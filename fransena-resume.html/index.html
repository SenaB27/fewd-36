	<h2> About Me </h2>

	<p> Hi, I'm Fransena Harmon I am originally from New Jersey but have lived in California for most of my life. I grew up in Santa Rosa Ca, where I went to elementary school through College.
	I have a background in Human Resources, Sales, Management and merchandising. Fortunately for the last three years I was able to switch into a music and promotions field which I can honestly say is my passion.</p>

	<p>I work with different music artists to bring their artistry and brand to the forefront of the ever changing media circuit. My experience is in networking, booking, and promoting their events at different venues in and around the San Francisco and East bay area. Along with local promotions I have experience in setting up tour dates and concerts in other cities within the United States.
	Other duties have been a personal stylist to music artists, and helped design sets for music videos and commercials.</p>

	<p>With hard work and perseverance, I expect to someday be good enough at website development and design to implement that into my A&R work. In doing so that in return will help me build a stronger network and skill set for my own personal brand.</p>
